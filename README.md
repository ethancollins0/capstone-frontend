# Water.pi
*A Web App to Automate Monitoring and Watering of Plants!*

![intro](https://github.com/ethancollins0/capstone-backend/blob/master/GitFiles/Home.png)

Water.pi is a web app I made in 3 weeks at Flatiron School. The app allows a user to signup and login, and securely keeps the user logged in using JWT. The user can go to their home page, and see a list of all of their pi's, and easily navigate to a page to add more pi's to their collection. The home page allows the user to see whether their pi's are online, and see whether the plant needs to be watered. Finally, it lets the user know if the plant is being watered by the pi.
